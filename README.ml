# Sudoku Solver Web API

This project is a microservice web API built in C# .NET that solves Sudoku puzzles. It's designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easily deployable.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Building and Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

2. Build the project:

3. Run the project:

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Running Tests

To run the integration tests:


## Building and Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

2. Run the Docker container:


The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Using the API

The API exposes a single endpoint:

- `POST /sudoku/solve`

To solve a Sudoku puzzle, send a POST request to this endpoint with a JSON body representing the puzzle. The puzzle should be a 9x9 grid represented as a 2D array, where 0 represents empty cells.

Example request body:

```json
{
"grid": [
 [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],
 [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],
 [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],
 [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],
 [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],
 [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],
 [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],
 [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],
 [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]
]
}


Now you have a complete Sudoku Solver Web API project with the following features:

1. A C# .NET Web API that solves Sudoku puzzles
2. Input validation and error handling
3. Logging
4. Integration tests
5. Dockerization for easy deployment
6. A README file with instructions on how to build, run, and use the service

You can now push this project to a Git repository of your choice (e.g., GitHub) for sharing and collaboration.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain further or any improvements you'd like to make to the project?
